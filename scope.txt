AutoJob:

- trawl jobsites every day for jobs
	- check jobs by scraping indeed and S1
		- run searches "physics" "c++" "junior software" "java"
		- I need to account for multiple pages
	- searches for certain terms (c++, junior, software)
	- ranks by appropriateness
	- removes any that have certain words (eg. "senior" "teacher") } instead this should be reflected in appropriateness

- create a job profile
		- list the job profile, where the application can be found, the date it was applied to
		- assign a number

- create application
	- creates CV
		- matches search terms to prepared CV terms
	- creates cover letter
		- matches search terms to prepared paragraphs

- once application is complete, it emails with a message
	- "Hi! This application has been submitted by a bot.  I matched your listing to Jon's requirements.  We hope to hear from you soon.

	   Regards,
		
	   Jon and AutoJon

	   If there are problems with this bot you can help by providing feedback about what went wrong"
